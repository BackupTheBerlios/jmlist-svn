jMList README

   ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Disclaimer

   This program is free software. It is distributed with the hope it will be
   useful. The developers hold no responsability for any damage caused by the
   use of this program.

Supported Platforms

   jMList is written with reasonable effort to make it portable, and most
   systems should compile it without problem. GLib is used as a portability
   layer between the operating system and jMList, and other libraries which
   jMList depends on are also reported to work on a great variety of systems.

   However, the only platforms where jMList was tested, by the time of this
   writing, are:

     o Linux 2.6, glibc 2.3 (main development system).

     o Linux 2.4, glibc 2.2.

   You should be able to compile and run jMList on any Unix-alike system
   (including Windows MSYS/MingW) where the required libraries run. If you
   manage to compile jMList on a system not listed above, please report to
   our mailing list so it get listed here.

Installation

  Requirements

   In order to compile jMList, you need the following libraries already
   installed on your system.

  Note

   If you are using a Linux distribution, you will need to install also the
   development (-devel) packages.

   GLib 2.4.0 (required)

           http://www.gtk.org/

           This is used as a compatibility layer between jMList and your
           operating system. GLib also provides several handy functions and
           data types that make programming easy. If you are running a Linux
           OS, chances are that you already have this installed. You may need
           just to get the -devel packages from your distribution CDs and
           install them.

   LibXML 2.6.0 and LibXSLT 1.1.0 (required)

           http://xmlsoft.org/

           Used for XML generation and transform. Also, these are quite
           simple to get installed and running without any hassle if you are
           running a Linux OS. Check your distribution CDs.

   ID3Lib 3.8.0 (required)

           http://id3lib.sourceforge.net/

           This is used to extract ID3v2 tags from MP3 files.

   OggVorbis 1.1.0 (optional)

           http://www.xiph.org/ogg/vorbis/

           You need to install OggVorbis (both libogg and libvorbis) only if
           you want support for OGG Vorbis files.

  Basic Installation

   If everything is setup properly and all requirements are met, jMList
   configuration and installation is as simple as:

         cd jmlist-0.1.0
         ./configure
         make
         make install
      

   Binaries will be installed on /usr/local/bin and data files on
   /usr/local/share/jmlist. For more detailed, generic, installation
   instructions, refer to the INSTALL file.
